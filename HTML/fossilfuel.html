                  climate change. Here are eight reasons why we need to phase out fossil fuels once and for all.</h3>

            <!------------Some deatails about current situation with photos------------>
          <div class="reasons">
              <h1>1. Fossil fuels = Climate change</h1>
                <p>Let’s start with the basics. Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas results in carbon
                    pollution, which causes climate change. So if we want to stop climate change (and avoid devastating 
                    extreme weather, sea level rise wiping out communities, global conflict and instability, etc.), we have
                     to stop burning fossil fuels. That wasn’t so hard, was it!</p>
                     <h1>2. We already have more fossil fuels that we can use</h1>
                     <p>
                        A blockbuster report last year from the UN made it clear that, to limit warming to 1.5°C 
                        (and avoid the worst of the above terrible consequences), we basically have to cut carbon 
                        pollution in half by 2030. That’s soon! Every single new ton of carbon pollution pushes global
                         temperatures higher — and the total amount of carbon we can emit without going over that limit
                          is referred to as our “carbon budget.” Here’s the thing: fossil fuel corporations have discovered
                           roughly five times more oil, gas, and coal reserves than we can afford to burn and still limit
                            warming to 1.5°C. Even the amount of carbon found in fossil fuel production projects currently
                             moving forward (known as “developed reserves”) would by themselves push us past our climate targets.

                    <h1>3. The fossil fuel industry wants more</h1>
                    <p>Despite the crystal clear warnings from scientists, and the evidence pouring in 
                        every day that climate impacts are already here — fossil fuel companies are still
                         spending billions to lock in more climate pollution. In 2018, roughly $1.2 trillion
                          in investment went to fossil fuels. $170 billion went to fossil fuel supply projects
                           in the U.S. alone! We can’t let this happen. These companies and investors are
                            literally betting billions on us failing to address climate change, and it’s unacceptable.</p>

                   <h1>4. The fossil fuel industry has actually known about the climate crisis for decades</h1>
                   <p>Raking in massive profits while giving the bird to all future generations of humanity 
                       is not new for the fossil fuel industry. Investigations have uncovered that the industry
                        was funding research into carbon pollution and was aware of the dangers of rising global 
                        temperatures all the way back in the 1960s. But instead of acting responsibly, companies 
                        like Exxon and Koch Industries funded a network of climate deniers to confuse the public,
                         polarize the issue, and delay action. It’s both tragic and enraging. What could have been a
                         difficult but manageable economic transition to clean renewable energy is — because of this 
                         industry — now an urgent planetary crisis that threatens the lives of millions.</p>

                         <h1>5. The fossil fuel industry mistreats workers</h1>
                         <p>Fossil fuel industry workers and the communities where they operate pay a price. 
                             The upstream oil and gas industry has “one of the highest rates of severe injuries
                              in the country,” and after years of decline, Appalachian coal miners are seeing 
                              a comeback of black lung disease. As the coal industry has declined, corporate 
                              bosses have stiffed workers: As “companies declare bankruptcy, executives get 
                              healthy bonuses, polluted coal mines are abandoned, and miners and retirees are 
                              denied long-promised health benefits and pensions.”</p>
                              <h1>6. Clean air? They’re not worried about it</h1>
                              <p>On top of creating the climate crisis, burning fossil fuels also creates local 
                                  air pollution. One kind, known as PM2.5, is soot so small it can actually enter
                                   your bloodstream, increasing the risk of death from stroke, heart disease,
                                    lung cancer, and respiratory illness among those exposed. Laws like the Clean
                                     Air Act have reduced health threats from air pollution since they were enacted
                                      in the 1970s, but polluters have fought them every step of the way. Tens of
                                       thousands of Americans still die every year from air pollution, and Trump’s
                                        attempted rollback of clean air protections could lead to 80,000 additional
                                         deaths every decade.</p>

                                         <p>The water pollution story is no better. Time and time again, oil spills and explosions have
                                              wreaked havoc on water, land, and homes and communities. Major incidents — such as BP’s 
                                              Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, which spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of 
                                              Mexico, or Enbridge’s massive tar sands spill into the Kalamazoo River — show that there 
                                              is no really safe way to extract, process, or transport fossil fuels. When there’s drillin’,
                                               there’s spillin’. It’s one of the issues that has sparked the Indigenous-led movement of 
                                               water protectors and allies has risen up to oppose risky, climate-wrecking pipeline projects 
                                               across the country such as Dakota Access, Keystone XL, and the Line 3 expansion. And if that 
                                               weren’t enough, coal ash — the byproduct of burning coal in power plants — is incredibly toxic,
                                                is often stored in unregulated impoundment ponds, and can easily leak or spill into waterways.</p>

                                                         found that climate change could “push more than 120 million more people into poverty by 2030
