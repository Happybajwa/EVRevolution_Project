       <h2> Over the last decade, there’s been an increase in the purchasing of electric vehicles (EV). There are many reasons why 
        one might consider making the switch to an EV – electric cars are higher efficiency than gas-powered cars, can reduce your dependence on fossil fuels and require less maintenance than most cars.</h2>

       <h1>Benefits Of Electrifying Transportation</h1>
       <p>Switching from a gas-powered car to an electric vehicle has huge environmental and public health
            benefits. A vehicle running only on electricity has zero tail-pipe emissions. Even if you account
             for the emissions associated with producing the electricity to charge them, electric vehicles
             charged with electricity in New England produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than vehicles
              powered by internal combustion engines.The Union of Concerned Scientists has done the math and has 
              a great EV Emissions Tool on its website. You can plug in your zipcode and any make and model of
               EV to find out what emissions it would be responsible for, per mile driven.</p>

               <p>In addition to substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions, electric vehicles significantly cut
                    down on the pollutants released by gas-powered cars that cause so many public health problems. <br> <br>

                In sum, the benefits of electric vehicles are huge: we cannot meet our climate goals without them and 
                they are crucial to bettering our public health. Though our Drive Green program focuses on passenger
                 vehicles, we are strong proponents of electrifying everything, particularly public transportation.</p>

                    <h1>EV Benefits Increase Over Time</h1>

                        <li>Newer models of electric vehicles are more efficient in terms of the number of miles
                             they can drive per kilowatt-hour of electricity, and we expect this trend to continue.</li>
                         <li>Our New England electric grid is getting greener with each passing year, thanks to laws like
                              the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard and Rhode Island Renewable Energy Standard. 
                              They require electricity suppliers to increase their renewable energy content each year.</li>    
                        <li>Communities in Massachusetts and Rhode Island are choosing to aggregate their electricity purchasing
                             for ratepayers, saving money and providing the option to support the development of renewable energy
                              beyond what is required by state law. </li>
